### WHERE CLAUSE IN PqSQL
- The PostgreSQL WHERE clause is used to filter results returned by the SELECT statement.
- The condition evaluates to true, false, or unknown. It can either be a Boolean expression or a combination of Boolean expressions where AND and OR operators are used.
- The WHERE clause can also be used with the UPDATE and DELETE statement to specify rows to be updated or deleted.
